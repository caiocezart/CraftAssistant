# CraftAssistant

ðŸ”¨ **CraftAssistant Plugin (Pre-Release)** ðŸ”¨

A new Path of Exile crafting helper plugin for ExileCore2! This is an early version, so expect some bugs and limited functionality.

**Current Features:**

- Load and analyze items to see detailed crafting information
- View all possible prefixes and suffixes for your item
- See tier information including iLvl requirements and weights
- Highlights lowest iLvl affixes in red for easy identification
- View all available tiers for each mod with their respective weights and chances
- Save and manage multiple items for comparison

**Texture Support:**

- Supports both standalone and steam Game versions
- Textures are optional - plugin works fine without them
- To enable textures:
  - Compile and run the included ExileCore2TexturesHandler.exe
  - More info on how to use it can be found in the plugin settings, tab Textures

*The project that generates the Textures Handler executable is included in the repository if you prefer compiling it yourself.*

**Important Notes:**

- This is a pre-release version - bugs are expected
- Crafting simulation features are still in development
- Currently best used as an item analysis tool
- Please report any bugs or issues you encounter

**Coming Soon:**

- Crafting simulation
- More detailed mod analysis
- Better UI/UX improvements
